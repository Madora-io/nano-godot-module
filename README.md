# Godot Nano Module
A Godot module to simplify use of Nano currency with the game engine. 

# Getting Started
1. This is a C++ Godot Module, which means it requires recompiling the engine. Learn more about how to do this with the Godot documentation: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/index.html
2. Once you can compile the engine, the next step is to include this module in the compilation. Simply clone this repository into your godot/modules directory, and recompile. 
3. You are now ready to begin using the module. Make sure to start Godot using your compiled binaries. To check that everything is working correctly, ensure that documentation is available for classes such as NanoAccount, NanoRequest, etc.
